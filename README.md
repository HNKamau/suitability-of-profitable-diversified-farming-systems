We predict the spatial global distribution of profitable diversified farming systems through niche modelling using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach. We used 114 known locations of profitable diversified farming practices obtained from a meta-analysis that compared the financial outcomes of diversified versus simplified farming practices (SÃ¡nchez et al., 2022). We then combined the known locations with spatial explicit information on different contextual condition to predict the global distribution of profitable locations. Finally, we combined the predicted global distribution with knowledge about biophysical potential for cropland expansion and intensification.

This R script is meant for species distribution modelling using kuenm package (Cobos et al., 2019) to perform suitability modelling.
